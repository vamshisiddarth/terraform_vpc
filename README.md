What Do We Achieve with This?
1.Create vpc with CIDR block 10.0.0.0/16
2.Create public subnet in above vpc with CIDR block 10.0.1.0/24
3.Create private subnet in above vpc with CIDR block 10.0.2.0/24

3.Generate the .PEM, .ppk files and place in the same location as cloud.tf and vars.tf.
4.On a linux machine, execute the following<\br>
ssh-keygen -y -f .pem
5.Copy the output and paste it in a empty file and this will be <Your_Key>. Maintain this in the same directory as other .tf files.
